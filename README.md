### Requirements

- node 16
- yarn 1.22
- docker 20.10.6
- docker-compose 1.29.1

### Installation

Simply run `yarn install` to install all needed packages. The Post-Install Script will also setup the husky hooks.
If you need to seed the database, please go in to the server folder and run `yarn seed`. This should seed the database from the json object which was given.

## To test the application
Please go in to the server folder and run `yarn start`. On a separate terminal please go in to the client folder and run `yarn watch`. This should start both back
and front end of the project easily.


### Development

```bash
yarn watch:dc
```

If you want to start it in background, append `-d`.

- Storybook: `yarn watch:sb`
- Next.js Frontend: `yarn watch`

Storybook will run on [Port 9009](http://localhost:9009) while Next.js / fastify will listen on [Port 1337](http://localhost:1337) by default.

### Production

Production Deployment is handled by docker / docker-compose.
