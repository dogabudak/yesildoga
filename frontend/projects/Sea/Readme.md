### Sea Charity Project Description

#### Background:

The project involves the deployment of a River Plastic Interceptor, which is a floating barrier system developed by the Ocean Cleanup, in the Aksu Stream.

The interceptor is designed to capture plastic waste and other debris as it flows downstream, preventing it from entering the Mediterranean Sea.

The Aksu Stream is a major waterway in Antalya that is heavily impacted by plastic pollution,
with large amounts of plastic waste entering the stream from nearby urban and residential areas. The River Plastic Interceptor will be deployed at the mouth of the stream, where it empties into the sea, and will be capable of capturing up to 50 tons of plastic waste per year.

## Estimated Cost for the Project

**System Design and Production:** The design and production of an Ocean Cleanup system will depend on the specific needs of the river and the amount of plastic waste present. The cost of designing and producing the system could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars.

**Installation and Maintenance:** The installation and maintenance of the Ocean Cleanup system will require skilled labor and ongoing maintenance. The cost of installation and maintenance could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars per year.

**Operating Costs:** The operating costs of an Ocean Cleanup system will include the cost of energy for powering the system and the cost of personnel to operate and monitor the system. The operating costs could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars per year.

Overall, a rough estimation of the costs involved in implementing an Ocean Cleanup system for a small scale river would be 10,000$ .
