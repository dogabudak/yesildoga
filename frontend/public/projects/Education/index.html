    <h1>Education Charity Project Description</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In Turkey, many poor children living in villages have to walk long distances to reach the nearest school, which can be a significant obstacle to their education. Our charity organization aims to remove this obstacle by providing free transport to these children so that they can attend school regularly and receive a quality education.</p>

        <h2>Estimated Cost for the Project</h2>
        <p>The estimated cost for this project will depend on several factors, including the number of children who will be transported, the distance they will travel, and the mode of transportation. Here are some possible cost factors to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Depending on the number of children who will be transported, the organization may need to purchase or rent one or more vehicles. The cost of each vehicle will depend on factors such as the make and model, age, and condition. Additionally, there will be ongoing costs for fuel, maintenance, and repairs.</li>
            <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> The organization may need to hire one or more drivers to transport the children. The cost of hiring drivers will depend on factors such as their qualifications, experience, and wages.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> The organization will need to obtain insurance coverage for the vehicles and drivers. The cost of insurance will depend on factors such as the level of coverage, the number of vehicles and drivers, and the organization's claims history.</li>
            <li><strong>Administration:</strong> There will be administrative costs associated with managing the transportation program, such as salaries for staff, office expenses, and transportation logistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Contingency:</strong> It's important to factor in some contingency funds to cover unforeseen expenses that may arise during the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on these factors, the estimated cost for this project could range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of Turkish liras. The organization will need to carefully plan and budget for each expense to ensure that the project is financially sustainable.</p>
